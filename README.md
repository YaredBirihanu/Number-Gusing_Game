Description:
The Python Number Guessing Game is an engaging and interactive terminal-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project is designed to be simple yet fun, making it an excellent introduction to programming concepts in Python.
How It Works:
Upon starting the game, a random number is generated, and the player is prompted to guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the number, adding an element of challenge and excitement.
Features:
Random Number Generation: Utilizes Python's random module to generate a number within a defined range.
User Input: Players can input their guesses, which are validated for correctness.
Feedback Mechanism: The game informs players if their guess is too high or too low, guiding them toward the correct answer.
Replay Option: After a game concludes, players can choose to play again, enhancing replayability.
